# Neoid

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/elado/neoid.png)](http://travis-ci.org/elado/neoid)



Make your ActiveRecords stored and searchable on Neo4j graph database, in order to make fast graph queries that MySQL would crawl while doing them.

Neoid to Neo4j is like Sunspot to Solr. You get the benefits of Neo4j speed while keeping your schema on your plain old RDBMS.

Neoid doesn't require JRuby. It's based on the great [Neography](https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography) gem which uses Neo4j's REST API.

Neoid offers querying Neo4j for IDs of objects and then fetch them from your RDBMS, or storing all desired data on Neo4j.



## Installation

Add to your Gemfile and run the `bundle` command to install it.

	gem 'neoid', git: 'git://github.com/elado/neoid.git'

**Requires Ruby 1.9.2 or later.**

## Usage

### First app configuration:

In an initializer, such as `config/initializers/01_neo4j.rb`:

	ENV["NEO4J_URL"] ||= "http://localhost:7474"

	uri = URI.parse(ENV["NEO4J_URL"])

    $neo = Neography::Rest.new(uri.to_s)

    Neography::Config.tap do |c|
      c.server = uri.host
      c.port = uri.port

      if uri.user && uri.password
        c.authentication = 'basic'
        c.username = uri.user
        c.password = uri.password
      end
    end

    Neoid.db = $neo


`01_` in the file name is in order to get this file loaded first, before the models (files are loaded alphabetically).

If you have a better idea (I bet you do!) please let me know.


### ActiveRecord configuration

#### Nodes

For nodes, first include the `Neoid::Node` module in your model:


	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Neoid::Node
	end


This will help to create a corresponding node on Neo4j when a user is created, delete it when a user is destroyed, and update it if needed.

Then, you can customize what fields will be saved on the node in Neo4j, inside neoidable configuration:


	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Neoid::Node
	  
	  neoidable do |c|
	  	c.field :slug
	  	c.field :display_name
		c.field :display_name_length do
		  self.display_name.length
		end
	  end
	end


#### Relationships

Let's assume that a `User` can `Like` `Movie`s:


	# user.rb

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Neoid::Node
    
	  has_many :likes
      has_many :movies, through: :likes
    
	  neoidable do |c|
	  	c.field :slug
	  	c.field :display_name
	  end
	end


	# movie.rb

	class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Neoid::Node
    
	  has_many :likes
      has_many :users, through: :likes
    
	  neoidable do |c|
	  	c.field :slug
	  	c.field :name
	  end
	end


	# like.rb

	class Like < ActiveRecord::Base
	  belongs_to :user
      belongs_to :movie
	end



Now let's make the `Like` model a Neoid, by including the `Neoid::Relationship` module, and define the relationship (start & end nodes and relationship type) options with `neoidable` config and `relationship` method:


	class Like < ActiveRecord::Base
	  belongs_to :user
	  belongs_to :movie

	  include Neoid::Relationship

	  neoidable start_node: :user, end_node: :movie, type: :likes
	  
	end


Neoid adds `neo_node` and `neo_relationships` to nodes and relationships, respectively.

So you could do:

	user = User.create!(display_name: "elado")
	user.movies << Movie.create("Memento")
	user.movies << Movie.create("Inception")

	user.neo_node                # => #<Neography::Nodeâ€¦>
	user.neo_node.display_name   # => "elado"

	rel = user.likes.first.neo_relationship
	rel.start_node  # user.neo_node
	rel.end_node    # user.movies.first.neo_node
	rel.rel_type    # 'likes'


## Index for Full-Text Search

Using `search` block inside a `neoidable` block, you can store certain fields.

	# movie.rb

	class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Neoid::Node

	  neoidable do |c|
	    c.field :slug
	    c.field :name

	    c.search do |s|
	      # full-text index fields
	      s.fulltext :name
	      s.fulltext :description

	      # just index for exact matches
	      s.index :year
	    end
	  end
	end

Records will be automatically indexed when inserted or updated.

## Querying

You can query with all [Neography](https://github.com/maxdemarzi/neography)'s API: `traverse`, `execute_query` for Cypher, and `execute_script` for Gremlin.

### Gremlin Example:

These examples query Neo4j using Gremlin for IDs of objects, and then fetches them from ActiveRecord with an `in` query.

Of course, you can store using the `neoidable do |c| c.field ... end` all the data you need in Neo4j and avoid querying ActiveRecord.


**Most popular categories**

	gremlin_query = <<-GREMLIN
	  m = [:]

	  g.v(0)
	    .out('movies_subref').out
          .inE('likes')
          .inV
          .groupCount(m).iterate()

	  m.sort{-it.value}.collect{it.key.ar_id}
	GREMLIN

	movie_ids = Neoid.db.execute_script(gremlin_query)

	Movie.where(id: movie_ids)


Assuming we have another `Friendship` model which is a relationship with start/end nodes of `user` and type of `friends`,

**Movies of user friends that the user doesn't have**

	user = User.find(1)

	gremlin_query = <<-GREMLIN
	  u = g.idx('users_index')[[ar_id:'#{user.id}']].next()
	  movies = []

	  u
		.out('likes').aggregate(movies).back(2)
	    .out('friends').out('likes')
		.dedup
		.except(movies).collect{it.ar_id}
	GREMLIN

	movie_ids = Neoid.db.execute_script(gremlin_query)

	Movie.where(id: movie_ids)


`.next()` is in order to get a vertex object which we can actually query on.


### Full Text Search

	# will match all movies with full-text match for name/description. returns ActiveRecord instanced
	Movie.search("*hello*").results

	# same as above but returns hashes with the values that were indexed on Neo4j
	Movie.search("*hello*").hits

	# search in multiple types
	Neoid.search([Movie, User], "hello")

	# search with exact matches (pass a hash of field/value)
	Movie.search(year: 2013).results


## Behind The Scenes

Whenever the `neo_node` on nodes or `neo_relationship` on relationships is called, Neoid checks if there's a corresponding node/relationship in Neo4j. If not, it does the following:

### For Nodes:

1. Ensures there's a sub reference node (read [here](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/tutorials-java-embedded-index.html) about sub reference nodes)
2. Creates a node based on the ActiveRecord, with the `id` attribute and all other attributes from `neoidable`'s field list
3. Creates a relationship between the sub reference node and the newly created node
4. Adds the ActiveRecord `id` to a node index, pointing to the Neo4j node id, for fast lookup in the future

Then, when it needs to find it again, it just seeks the node index with that ActiveRecord id for its neo node id.

### For Relationships:

Like Nodes, it uses an index (relationship index) to look up a relationship by ActiveRecord id

1. With the options passed in the `neoidable`, it fetches the `start_node` and `end_node`
2. Then, it calls `neo_node` on both, in order to create the Neo4j nodes if they're not created yet, and creates the relationship with the type from the options.
3. Add the relationship to the relationship index.

## Testing

In order to test your app or this gem, you need a running Neo4j database, dedicated to tests.

I use port 7574 for this. To run another database locally:

Copy the entire Neo4j database folder to a different location,

**or**

symlink `bin`, `lib`, `plugins`, `system`, copy `conf` to a single folder, and create an empty `data` folder.

Then, edit `conf/neo4j-server.properties` and set the port (`org.neo4j.server.webserver.port`) from 7474 to 7574 and run the server with `bin/neo4j start`

**You also want clean DB addon:**

Download, install and configure [neo4j-clean-remote-db-addon](https://github.com/jexp/neo4j-clean-remote-db-addon). For the test database, leave the default `secret-key` key.

## Testing Your App with Neoid (RSpec)

In `environments/test.rb`, add:

	ENV["NEO4J_URL"] = 'http://localhost:7574'

In your `spec_helper.rb`, add the following configurations:

    config.before :all do
      Neoid.clean_db(:yes_i_am_sure)
    end

    config.before :each do
      Neoid.reset_cached_variables
    end


## Testing This Gem

Just run `rake` from the gem folder.
